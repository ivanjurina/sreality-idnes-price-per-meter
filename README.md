# Czech Real Estate Price Per M¬≤ Calculator

A Chrome extension that automatically calculates and displays the price per square meter for property listings on Czech real estate portals [sreality.cz](https://www.sreality.cz) and [reality.idnes.cz](https://reality.idnes.cz).

## Supported Websites

- **sreality.cz** - Czech Republic's largest real estate portal
- **reality.idnes.cz** - Popular real estate section of iDNES.cz

## Features

- üåê **Multi-Site Support** - Works seamlessly on both major Czech real estate portals
- üî¢ **Automatic Calculation** - Instantly calculates price per m¬≤ for all visible listings
- üîÑ **Dynamic Updates** - Works with infinite scroll, lazy-loaded content, and AJAX navigation
- üíô **Clean Display** - Shows price/m¬≤ in distinctive blue text below the total price
- üéØ **Smart Detection** - Automatically adapts to each website's HTML structure
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-time Monitoring** - Updates continuously as new listings appear or pages change

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the extension folder containing the files
6. Visit [sreality.cz](https://www.sreality.cz) or [reality.idnes.cz](https://reality.idnes.cz)
7. The price per m¬≤ will automatically appear under each listing's price

## Files

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration with permissions for both websites
- `content.js` - Main calculation logic with site-specific parsing functions
- `styles.css` - Styling for the price per m¬≤ display on both portals
- `icon.png` - Extension icon (128x128px)

## How It Works

The extension automatically detects which website you're visiting and applies the appropriate parsing logic:

### For sreality.cz:
- Identifies listings by their ID patterns (`estate-list-item-*`)
- Extracts size from property description paragraphs
- Parses price from the price container element

### For reality.idnes.cz:
- Finds listings within `.c-products__item` containers
- Extracts size from the `.c-products__title` element
- Gets price from `.c-products__price strong` element

Both sites display the calculated price per m¬≤ in a consistent blue color with a money emoji (üí∞) for easy identification.
